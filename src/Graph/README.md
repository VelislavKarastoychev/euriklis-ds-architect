# Graph library

The Graph library is a generic Graph class which supports the main methods and functionalities for Graphs. It is a trivial Graph library which allow to the user to build a graph and to execute the main graph algorithms like BFS and DFS, ass well as finding edges or nodes which satisfy given conditions.

## Structure of the Graph library.

The main class of the library is the Graph.
Each Graph is a generic instance, so we need to define the structure of the nodes and the edges of it, as well as the State of the Graph and if it is directed or undirected. The initialization of a graph have to be done with the following way:
directed
